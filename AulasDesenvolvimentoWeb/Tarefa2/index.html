    <h1>Diggy Diggy Hole</h1>

    <p>Diggy Diggy Hole<br>
        Brothers of the mine rejoice!<br>
        Swing, swing, swing with me<br>
        Raise your pick and raise your voice!<br>
        Sing, sing, sing with me<br>
        <br>
        Down and down into the deep<br>
        Who knows what we'll find beneath?<br>
        Diamonds, rubies, gold and more<br>
        Hidden in the mountain store<br>
        <br>
        Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone<br>
        Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home<br>
        Skin made of iron, steel in our bones<br>
        To dig and dig makes us free<br>
        Come on brothers sing with me!<br>
        <br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole<br>
        <br>
        The sunlight will not reach this low<br>
        Deep, deep in the mine<br>
        Never seen the blue moon glow<br>
        Dwarves won't fly so high<br>
        <br>
        Fill a glass and down some mead!<br>
        Stuff your bellies at the feast!<br>
        Stumble home and fall asleep<br>
        Dreaming in our mountain keep<br>
        <br>
        Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb<br>
        The earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tomb<br>
        Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom<br>
        We do not fear what lies beneath<br>
        We can never dig too deep<br>
        <br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole<br>
        <br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole<br>
        <br>
        Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone<br>
        Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home<br>
        Skin made of iron, steel in our bones<br>
        To dig and dig makes us free<br>
        Come on brothers sing with me!<br>
        <br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole<br>
        <br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br>
        I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole<br>
        Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole</p>
